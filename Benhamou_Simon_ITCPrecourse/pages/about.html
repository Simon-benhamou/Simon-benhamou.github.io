    <h1 class ="titlecenter">Why coding?</h1>
    <p class ="paragraphwidth"> 
           I had the chance to work alongside developers when I worked at Colmobil  and I quickly understood that coding will be the reading and writing of the future. I got used to solving any 
          different types of problems and I absolutely adore it. I understood that coding will give me a new way of looking at issue and shape my thinking process.
