# Tweeter React App 

The purpose was to create an app that allows users to tweet and stock the tweet to a database. I used Firebase. 
firebase Authentification  for log in (email,password and sign in with google)
firestore to store their all the tweets
storage to store profileImage according to the current user logged in.
